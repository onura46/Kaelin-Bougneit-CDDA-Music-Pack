# Kaelin Bougneit CDDA Music Pack

This music pack is designed for use with **Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead**, a post-apocalyptic zombie survival game, found here: https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA.

There are a variety of beatless tracks, inspired by everyone from Lustmord, zoviet france, and SleepResearch_Facility, to Boards of Canada and early Current 93. They are designed to be as immersive and unobtrusive as possible. It's still very WIP and will be updated occasionally in the future.

## Installation

1. Download this repo. 
2. Find your CDDA folder. If you're using a launcher, this may be in your Documents (Windows) or `~/.cataclysm-dda/` (Linux). Otherwise it's the folder you launch CDDA from. 
3. Find your current in-game soundpack and navigate to its associated folder (usually something like `data/sound/Basic` <- Basic is the default).
4. (Optional) Back up your soundpacks.
5. Delete your current `musicset.json`, if you have one. Optionally, you may delete any associated files listed in it. If you use a custom soundpack, it's likely all of this is found in a `music` folder for your convenience. 
6. Paste the contents of this repo into the soundpack. This music pack is now integrated with your chosen soundpack.
