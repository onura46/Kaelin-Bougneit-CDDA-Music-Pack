# Kaelin Bougneit CDDA Music Pack

This music pack is designed for use with **Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead**, a post-apocalyptic zombie survival game, found here: https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA.

The background tracks *(inspired by Lustmord, zoviet france, and SleepResearch_Facility)* are designed to be as immersive and unobtrusive as possible. You can hear more melodic, foreground tracks *(pretty openly imitating Boards of Canada)* while listening to MP3 players in the game. It's still very WIP and will be updated occasionally in the future.

## Installation

1. Download this repo. 
2. Find your CDDA folder. If you're using a launcher, this may be in your Documents. Otherwise it's the folder you launch CDDA from. 
3. Find your current in-game soundpack and navigate to its associated folder (usually something like data/sound/Basic <- Basic is the default).
4. (Optional) Back up your soundpacks.
5. Delete your current 'musicset.json', if you have one. Optionally, you may delete any associated files listed in it. If you use a custom soundpack, it's likely all of this is found in a 'music' folder for your convenience. 
6. Paste the contents of this repo into the soundpack. This music pack is now integrated with your chosen soundpack.
